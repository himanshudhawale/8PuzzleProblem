### 8 Puzzle Problem using A star algorithm

The 8-puzzle problem involves a set of eight numbered movable tiles in a 3x3 frame. One cell of the frame is kept blank, thus allowing the adjacent tiles to change their location. The program is to change the initial configuration into the goal configuration. A solution to the problem is an appropriate sequence of moves, such as “move tiles 5 to the right, move tile 7 to the left, move tile 6 to the down, etc”. Problem Formulation: Goal: pieces should end up in order shown as goal state States: integer locations of tiles Actions: move blank left, right, up, down Path cost: 1 per move Performance measure: minimize total moves Solution: sequence of pieces moved
